# Golang Cryptocurrency Codebase Refactoring Plan

## Phase 1: Security & Core Architecture

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement secure key management system
- [ ] Add transaction signing validation layer
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Implement secure logging (no sensitive data)

### Core Architecture Restructuring
- [ ] Separate wallet management from transaction processing
- [ ] Implement clean architecture layers:
  ```
  /internal
    /domain      # Business logic
    /ports       # Interfaces
    /adapters    # External implementations
    /services    # Application services
  ```
- [ ] Create interfaces for external service communications
- [ ] Implement dependency injection

## Phase 2: SOLID Implementation

### Single Responsibility
- [ ] Split wallet service:
  - Key management
  - Transaction handling
  - Balance tracking
- [ ] Separate validation logic
- [ ] Extract notification system

### Open/Closed
- [ ] Create plugin system for:
  - New cryptocurrencies
  - Trading strategies
  - External integrations
- [ ] Implement strategy pattern for fee calculation

### Interface Segregation
- [ ] Break down wallet interface
- [ ] Separate read/write operations
- [ ] Create specific interfaces for different clients

### Dependency Inversion
- [ ] Define abstract interfaces for:
  - Blockchain nodes
  - Exchange APIs
  - Database operations
- [ ] Implement mock interfaces for testing

## Phase 3: Extensibility Features

### Integration Points
- [ ] Create abstraction for blockchain connectors
- [ ] Standardize exchange API interfaces
- [ ] Implement event system for:
  - Price updates
  - Transaction events
  - System alerts

### Modularity
- [ ] Create pluggable components for:
  - New trading pairs
  - Additional blockchains
  - Different order types
- [ ] Implement feature flags system

## Migration Strategy
1. Create new structures alongside existing code
2. Gradually move functionality
3. Run parallel systems
4. Switch over component by component
5. Maintain backward compatibility

## Monitoring Points
- Transaction processing times
- Memory usage patterns
- API response times
- Error rates
- Security events
